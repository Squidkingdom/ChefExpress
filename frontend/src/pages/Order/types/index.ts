/***************************************************************************************************
 * Name of code artifact: index.ts
 * Brief description of what the code does:
 *   This file defines TypeScript interfaces for product and cart item data structures used in the 
 *   application. It ensures consistent typing throughout the codebase wherever product or cart 
 *   item information is handled.
 * Programmerâ€™s name: Programmer 1
 * Date the code was created: Date 1
 * Dates the code was revised: Date 2
 * Brief description of each revision & author:
 *   Date 2 - Programmer 1: Added optional fields for rating, reviews, and description to the Product 
 *   interface to support enhanced product details.
 * Preconditions:
 *   - Used in a TypeScript environment.
 *   - Other parts of the application assume these interfaces accurately represent the data shape.
 * Acceptable and unacceptable input values or types, and their meanings:
 *   - `id`: number, a unique product identifier.
 *   - `name`: string, the product's name.
 *   - `price`: string, formatted price with a leading '$' (e.g. "$19.99").
 *   - `URL`: string, a link to the product page on an external site (e.g., Amazon).
 *   - `quantity` (in Product): string, representing how many items are available. In the Product 
 *     interface, it's stored as a string (could represent "N/A" or other textual data).
 *   - `category`: string, the product category.
 *   - `img`: string, the URL of the product image.
 *   - `rating` and `reviews`: optional numeric fields for product evaluation.
 *   - `description`: optional string providing additional product details.
 *   - In CartItem, `quantity` becomes a number to represent how many units of the product are 
 *     added to the cart.
 * Postconditions:
 *   - Provides strongly typed structures for products and cart items.
 * Return values or types:
 *   - `Product`: Interface describing product properties.
 *   - `CartItem`: Interface describing cart item properties, based on `Product` but with a numeric quantity.
 * Error and exception condition values or types:
 *   - None are explicitly handled here; these are type definitions only.
 * Side effects:
 *   - None, as these are just type definitions.
 * Invariants:
 *   - The `CartItem` interface always includes a numeric `quantity` instead of a string.
 * Any known faults:
 *   - None known. Assumes all data will adhere to the defined properties.
 * Comments summarizing major blocks of code:
 *   - `Product` interface: Defines the structure of product data.
 *   - `CartItem` interface: Extends `Product` but replaces `quantity` with a numeric field 
 *     to represent cart-specific state.
 * Comments on every line are provided below.
